# Automatic Text Summarization Using NetworkX and NLTK

This Python script provides a simple yet effective method for automatic text summarization based on cosine similarity between sentences. It leverages the NLTK library for natural language processing tasks and NetworkX for creating a graph representation of sentence similarities.



## Features


- **Automatic Text Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of text documents by extracting the most significant sentences.
- **Customizable**: Adjusts parameters such as stopwords, similarity metrics, and summarization algorithm to suit specific needs.
- **Scalable**: Handles large text documents efficiently, making it suitable for various text summarization applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated into larger systems or used as a standalone tool for summarizing text data.



## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- nltk
- numpy
- networkx

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:


- **pip install nltk numpy networkx**
Additionally, download NLTK's stopwords corpus by running the following command:
- **python -m nltk.downloader stopwords**

## Customization

- **Stopwords**: Customize the list of stopwords by modifying the stopwords_english list in the script.

- **Similarity Metrics**: Adjust the similarity metric used for computing sentence similarity.

- **Summarization Algorithm**: Experiment with different summarization algorithms to improve performance or cater to specific use cases.
